# Environmental Sustainability Working Group üå≥üåç‚ôªÔ∏è

Welcome to the Environmental Sustainability Working Group. This WG works with the open source community to define environmental sustainability factors for the cloud native landscape, incubate and advocate open source projects to observe and measure Cloud Native infrastructure carbon footprint, optimize and eventually reduce carbon footprint and promote Cloud Native infrastructure to combat environmental challenges. 

We want to raise awareness of environmental sustainability as a key element of open source development and support projects which foster an understanding of energy drivers. All activities should positively impact the community by changing mindset, increasing efficiency, and putting sustainability on everyone's agenda.

The [Environmental Sustainability](https://github.com/cncf/env-sustainability-wg/charter.md) WG Charter further outlines the scope of our group activities as well as the goals and intended deliverables.

## Governance
