# Environmental Sustainability WG Chair proposal process

1) Environmental Sustainability WG Co-chairs operate as a team. The Co-Chair team seeks to maintain full coverage of the leadership capabilities across the key qualities of industry experience, hands-on cloud-native and sustainability experience, as well as administrative experience needed to run a Environmental Sustainability WG.
2) If a clear successor for the exiting Co-Chair exists based on the merit of their contributions ("plant trees, carry water") and relevant experience that will benefit the WG, based on the WG's collective experience over time, the exiting Co-chair may nominate a successor.
3) The exiting Co-Chair should propose the desired successor to the other Co-Chairs. If there are any objections, the Co-Chair will have the opportunity to propose another worthy candidate. If Environmental Sustainability WG Chairs, Tech Leads and TOC Liaisons are unable to put forward a candidate, then a selection process will need to be agreed upon and executed.
4) If no new Chair candidate is available, the role will remain vacant until the Co-chair's, TOC Liaisons or CNCF TOC propose a replacement.
