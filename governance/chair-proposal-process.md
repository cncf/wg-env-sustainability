# Environmental Sustainability Leadership Team

The leadership team of the WG are servant leads. They are an enabler for the group and support the creation and success of the different activities. They are the driver for the group for not losing the higher targets out of sight and taking decisions when no consensus can be found.

## Team Structure

The leadership team is conducted of:
* Three Co-Chairs
* Three Tech Leads

As WG we strive to be a gender, company and geolocation, diverse group. 
Therefore, the whole leadership team is not allowed to have more than two people from the same organization. This also includes companies that belong through majority ownership to another company. 


# Proposal Process

## Environmental Sustainability WG Chair proposal process

1) Environmental Sustainability WG Co-chairs operate as a team. The Co-Chair team seeks to maintain full coverage of the leadership capabilities across the key qualities of industry experience, hands-on cloud-native and sustainability experience, as well as administrative experience needed to run a Environmental Sustainability WG. 
2) If a clear successor for the exiting Co-Chair exists based on the merit of their contributions ("plant trees, carry water") and relevant experience that will benefit the WG, based on the WG's collective experience over time, the exiting Co-chair may nominate a successor.
3) The exiting Co-Chair should propose the desired successor to the other Co-Chairs. If there are any objections, the Co-Chair will have the opportunity to propose another worthy candidate. If Environmental Sustainability WG Chairs, Tech Leads and TOC Liaisons are unable to put forward a candidate, then a selection process will need to be agreed upon and executed.
4) If no new Chair candidate is available, the role will remain vacant until the Co-chair's, TOC Liaisons or CNCF TOC propose a replacement.

## Evironmental Sustainability WG Technical Lead Proposal Process

Environmental Sustainability Technical Leads operate as a team alongside the Co-Chairs. The Co-Chair
team seeks enhance the leadership capabilities of the existing co-chairs across
the key qualities of industry experience, hands-on cloud-native and environmental sustainability
experience, as well as administrative experience needed to assist in the
execution of the various projects and efforts that make the WG so
successful.

## Caveats of Technical Leads

* The position of a technical lead does not guarantee future co-chair nomination
* The position of a technical lead is not a paid position (co-chairs are also
  not paid positions)
* Technical leads [have responsibilities](roles.md) to the WG, the
  leadership team, and the TOC

## Process of nominations

Depending on the needs of the community, as determined by the WG
leadership team, technical lead nominations may come in the form of "Nominees by
community", "Nominees by co-chairs", or both.

The WG does not have a current limit on the amount of technical leads.

Final technical lead nominations will adhere to the [CNCF's TOC described
process](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/main/tags/cncf-tags.md#elections).

### Nominees by community

Community nominees should adhere to the technical lead nomination requirements
described below. Any individual who is a member of the WG list or the
wg-environmental-sustainability slack channel may nominate another individual.

The co-chairs reserve the right to endorse a nominee by the community based on:

* Gender diversity
* Company diversity
* Geo diversity
* Amount of nominations from different companies, people, regions for a single
  individual
* Existing body of work
* Justification provided during nomination

#### Community timeline

Community nominations will run for at least 2 weeks with a maximum up to 2
months. Upon close of nominations a decision will be made by the co-chairs
within the next month in order to conform to the TOC process.

#### Submitting a nomination

> TBD

Nominations are to be submitted to [WG Co-Chairs email
alias](mailto:cncf-wg-envsus-chairs@lists.cncf.io) with the details:

* Subject "Technical Lead nomination: $NAME-OF-NOMINEE"
* CC the nominee
* TL requirements with examples (described below)
* Justification

#### Endorsement of community nominees

Co-chairs are responsible for providing endorsement of a community nominee to
show concurrence and support.

If no nominees are submitted by the community either as a result of lack of
participation, lack of requirements, or from co-chair specific selection
(non-community nomination process), the co-chairs must endeavor to nominate an
individual(s) that meet as many of the requirements as exist.

### Nominees by co-chairs

Nominees by co-chairs adhere to the technical lead requirements described below.
Co-chairs are responsible for documenting statistic information of all nominee
types for endorsement and presentation to the TOC.

## Technical Lead nomination requirements

In order to verify nominees by the community or by co-chairs have experience
with the group and are actively contributing in a meaningful way, the following
requirements must be met in order for an individual to be nominated.

If a given nominee does not meet all the requirements, the co-chairs will still
review the nomination and justification to determine if enough intent and
commitment is present to move forward with an endorsement.

Nominees must:

 * engaging in community chat via slack or lists

* agree to the nomination
<!-- markdownlint-enable MD005 MD007 -->

Nominations must:

* come from someone other than the nominee
* have justification from the nominator regarding the nominee's capabilities

### Justification for nominees

To ensure nominations are thoughtful and supported, in addition to the above
requirements, a justification must enumerate on the nominee's:

* Environmental Sustainability WG Community involvement
* leadership skills
* conflict resolution (technical and non-technical)
* mentorship
* willingness to learn and expand existing technical knowledge
* and any known affiliations or group memberships (if applicable)

## Announcing nomination results

The co-chairs will release aggregate information about the nominees at the end
of the nomination process once the Technical Leads have been put forward for
approval by the TOC. Aggregate information will not include who nominated
