# Roles within the WG

The WG includes several key roles that are critical to the group's success.
The group will have many members, all serving in varying capacities.  Within
this document, "member" may refer to a Chair, a Technical Lead, or other
Member roles.

Through the high variety of inputs we received during the WG creation phase and the different perspectives displayed, a member structure similar to a TAG will be suitable.

The following is the current listing of member roles:

* [Chairs](#role-of-chairs)
* [Technical Leads](#role-of-technical-leads)
* [Project Leads](#role-of-project-leads)
* [STAG Representatives](#role-of-stag-representatives)
* [Team leads](#role-of-team-leads)
* [Group Members](#role-of-members)
* [TOC Liaison](#toc-liaison)
* [Facilitation Roles](#facilitation-roles)

All members are identified in the WG [members](/members.md) file, with annotations
where they hold an additional role.

Members fulfilling any Roles in WG are responsible for understanding
and abiding the by the governance and policies defined in this group.
This commitment and execution of understanding includes not only commits to
the repo, but also to any approvals or direction required by their Role.

## Role of members

* The primary role of a member is to contribute expertise to the group.
* To add yourself as a member, submit a Pull Request (PR) adding yourself
to the list of members.

### Maintaining active members

* Members *SHOULD* remain active and responsive in their Roles.
* Members taking an extended leave of 1 or more months *SHOULD* coordinate with
other members to ensure the role is adequately staffed during the leave.
* Members going on leave for 1-3 months *MAY* work with other members to
identify a temporary replacement.
* Members of a role *SHOULD* remove any other members that have not
communicated a leave of absence and either cannot be reached for more than 1
month or are not fulfilling their documented responsibilities for more than 1
month. This may be done through a super-majority vote of members, or if there
are not enough *active* members to get a super-majority of votes cast, then
removal may occur through a super-majority vote of the Chairs.
* Members contribute to projects, according to the
  [process](process.md).

### Managing membership

* Membership disagreements may be escalated to the Chairs.  Disagreements
among the Chairs may be escalated to a Environmental Sustainability WG TOC Liaison. (yet tbd)
* Members *MAY* decide to step down at anytime and optionally propose a
replacement.

## Role of chairs

The Chairs serve in administrative roles, guiding the WG and support the decision taking. However, due to the pure complexity of the WG topic, the role of the chairs include also the activities of technical leads.

* Primary role of Chairs is to run operations and the governance of the group.
* The Chairs are responsible for ensuring that group meetings are planned
and facilitated effectively, while also engaging group members in leadership
roles. Effective facilitation includes (but is not limited to) the following
activities:
  * setting the agenda for meetings
  * extending discussion via asynchronous communication to be inclusive of
members who cannot attend a specific meeting time.
  * scheduling discussion of proposals that have been submitted
  * asking for new proposals to be made to address an identified need
  * partnering with Technical Leads to establish a roadmap and manage ongoing
    projects

If the WG has less than two Technical
Leads, any Chair may act as Technical Lead.

## Role of technical leads

Technical Leads (TLs) expand the bandwidth of the leadership team. Proposals
must have a TL or Chair working as an active sponsor (as detailed in
[WG process](process.md)).

The general list of activities for TL are:

* Establish new sub-projects
* Decommission existing sub-projects
* Resolve cross-sub-project technical issues and decisions
* Propose agenda items for meetings to ensure that open issues are
  discussed with the group when needed

[Environmental Sustainability WG TL nomination
process](tech-lead-proposal-process.md)

## Role of project leads

Project Leads lead specific projects where a deliverable has been defined
within the issue.

Project Leads are nominated and approved by the following process:

  1. Project Lead actively participates in the group, initiates the proposal or
  volunteers to take on a project that has been prioritized by the group
  1. A Chair or TL nominates a candidate, or requests the community to
  nominate in a slack thread
  1. The nomination is communicated via a pull request annotating the list
   of members in the [WG members](/members.md) with a link to the issue tracking
   the project or on the issue tracking the project if a README is not yet made.
  The nomination is typically open for a week (but may be shorter with LGTM
  of at least two Chairs).
  1. The issue is updated with the assignment of the project lead as "assignee"
  alongside the TAG Leadership member.
  1. Project Leads will be given the OWNER role of the directory or sub-directory
  for their team's activities in order to empower merge/approve.
  
### On-going projects
  
  On the occasion where a project becomes long term, Project Leads are also
  given the OWNER role of the directory or sub-directory along with 1 other
  nominated individual to ensure continuity in review and ongoing support of
  the project.

Depending on the expected length of the project, Project Leads may be assigned
as OWNERS of the project directory in this repository to help facilitate and
 moderate new content to the project.

### Duties of a project lead

Project leads are responsible for the following:

- Adhering to the [project process](process.md)
- Proposing and refining the project scope, goal and schedule
- Ensure smooth day-to-day operations of the project. This includes:
  - Ensuring meetings are scheduled, announced and recorded
  - Facilitation of meetings, ensuring minutes are recorded
- Ensure progress and status reports are communicated to the WG
representative of the project
- Resolving conflict within the project and escalating to leadership
when required
- Outreach and recruitment for the project
- Provide retrospective of a project to the WG

## Role of WG representatives

Environmental Sustainability WG representatives are leadership executive sponsors of a project. The
WG representative acts as a point of liaison with the WG leadership team
and takes on a role of mentorship for the project lead(s).

WG representatives are required to be part of the WG leadership team.
This includes co-chairs, technical leads and co-chair emeritus roles.
A WG representative may be of capacity of an individual contributor but
cannot be the project lead of the same project they are representing.

WG representatives are appointed through the following process:

- A member of the leadership indicates that they would like to be a WG
representative on a project by:
  - editing the issue's "WG Representative" field to their github ID.
  - setting the issue milestone to the corresponding milestone created for
  their github ID.
- WG representatives may change based on discretion of co-chairs.

### Duties of a WG representative

WG representatives are responsible for the following:

- Reporting back to the leadership on the status of the project, indicating
when the project requires external governance help. For example, these
include:
  - Project is understaffed or suffers from rampant scope creep.
  - Project is inactive and needs to be discontinued.
  - Inter-personal issues within leads and/or members causing disruption.
- Provide feedback to project lead to whether the current scope and operation
of a project is in line with the vision and governance of the WG.
- Mentorship of project leads on matters of leadership and governance process.
- Provide privilege facilities that a project lead does not have access to.
Examples are:
  - Creating a ServiceNow ticket with the CNCF for design help
  - Uploading of meeting recordings to youtube
  - Approval of messages to WG mailing list

## TOC liaison

> As WG we search for a deep alignment with the TOC and community, therefore, we apply TAG rules/processes

The [CNCF TAG](https://github.com/cncf/toc/blob/master/tags) process identifies
a TOC Liaison.  The WG Chairs are responsible for establishing effective
communication with the TOC liaison, including further communication to the
wider TOC upon request.

The TOC Liaison will occasionally prioritize WG activities, as needed by the
TOC, to further the [CNCF mission](https://github.com/cncf/foundation/blob/master/charter.md#1-mission-of-the-cloud-native-computing-foundation).

## Facilitation roles

Members often contribute by working in small groups that research and discuss
options and then share their findings with the rest of the group in a
presentation and typically contribute to the body of work in this
repository (via Pull Request). Some tasks can be effectively executed
by simply chiming in on a github issue and independently contributing a PR
without any particular role or authorization.

This section describes roles where more coordination is helpful and the
work benefits from identifying one or more members who will take
on specific responsibilities.  Our goal is to empower members to move forward
independently, while defining an approval process designed to support
communication and alignment across the wider group.

New roles in this section are typically defined after someone has acted in
that role for some time informally, then proposed as an on-going role by Pull
Request which must be approved by a majority of Chairs.  Process clarifications
are welcome and PRs can be approved by any single Chair.

### Meeting facilitator

The group meetings are an important part of community building and the
facilitator ensures a welcoming and inclusive atmosphere. In keeping with these
goals, the meeting facilitator has the following responsibilities:

* prepares the meeting notes with template and agenda
* coordinates with presenter, if applicable
* ensures there are scribes
* runs meeting check-in, including partner groups
* leads the meeting through the agenda

Prerequisites:

* active member
* history of regular attendance

One or more of the following:

* served in another facilitator role
* leader on a project team
* tech lead
* co-chair

Any member who meets the above qualifications is encouraged to add themselves
to the [list of people in this role](/.github/settings.yml).

### Meeting Scribe(s)

Each meeting must have at a minimal one scribe and preferable with two.

Scribe is expected to perform the following:

* Plan to coordinate/review meeting Agenda with facilitator via Slack before
start of meeting
* Summarize discussions and capture into meeting notes (not transcribe verbatim)
* Clarify and annotate actions as discussion progresses with assignee and due
dates
* Partner with Facilitator to capture major occurring items in the meeting
* Add links to issues being discussed if not already in Agenda
* Open new issues to track action items from meeting

### Project teams

Some ongoing projects may have teams where members are identified for
additional roles and may be required to have specific expertise. If needed, this roles will be specify within each project.
