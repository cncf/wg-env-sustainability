# First time contributors

We happily welcome our new contributors to this
community. If you are contributing to the CNCF
and/or Environmental Sustainability WG for the first time it is
okay if you feel overwhelmed. We, as a
community, are always there to help you
with any problems you are facing.
Open source is about collaboration and
we are always there to support
each other.

## Quick start

The purpose of this plan is to ensure that you become familiar with the team and
know how you will contribute. The first step is to get yourself familiar with
our mission at [Environmental Sustainability WG charter](../charter.md).

New members are advised to:

* Join the [CNCF Slack team](https://slack.cncf.io/), particularly
  [#wg-environmental-sustainability](https://cloud-native.slack.com/archives/C03F270PDU6) channel and
  introduce yourself.
* Initially go through the following documents in the repository:
  * [README.md](../README.md)
  * [CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md](../CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md)
  * [Governance and Processes](../governance/README.md)
* Regularly join one of the [Zoom meetings](https://github.com/cncf/wg-env-sustainability#meetings) at least for the first
  couple of months to get yourself up to speed.
* Here are multiple ways to get involved:
  * Join the meeting as advised above and express your area of interests or if
    you want to work on any specific issue.
  * Express your thoughts or ask questions on an issue you find interesting.
  * Choose an [good first issue](https://github.com/cncf/wg-env-sustainability/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), [help wanted](https://github.com/cncf/wg-env-sustainability/labels/help%20wanted) and
    comment on it expressing interest.

## Getting involved and contributing

As a new contributor, you might find
difficulties in understanding where to start.
Don't worry! We got you.

In the interest of getting more new people
involved, we have issues marked as
[good-first-issues](https://github.com/cncf/wg-env-sustainability/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22) and [help wanted](https://github.com/cncf/wg-env-sustainability/labels/help%20wanted).
These are issues that have a smaller scope,
and are great to start with.

The good-first-issues should also provide
you details on how to get things resolved or
how to proceed. If you find it is missing or
incomplete please tag the person who created
the issue and let them know.
